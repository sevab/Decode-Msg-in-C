## Decode-Msg-in-C
A coursework for History and Applications of C, Objective C, C++ and C# university module I took

### Compilation instructions
To compile the program cd into the CW1 directory and run compileLink file in bash using `sh compileLink`. This will compile the appropriate files in the src directory into the build directory and then run the decodeMessage program using an example coded message and example wheel file which is also located in the `src` directory.

To run decodeMessage program using your own wheel file and message place your wheel .txt file into the src directory and run the following command from within the CW1 directory:

```bash
./build/decodeMessage src/nameOfWheelFile.txt [list of integers]
```
